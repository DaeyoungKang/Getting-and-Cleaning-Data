`dataMeanStd` contains following columns. This code book describes in order of "(Column number) `(Variable name)` (Explanation)".
Although the names of the columns in `dataTidy` are the same as in `dataMeanStd`, the value is the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in `dataMeanStd`.
1 `Subject`: An identifier of the subjects who carried out the experiment (1 to 30).
